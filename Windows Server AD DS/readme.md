## Work in Progress...
Compilation of notes and screenshots I've taken while familiarizing myself with Active Directory Domain Services. I've mostly been experimenting with AD Users and Computers to create a mock environment consisting of user accounts placed in various departments, as well as working with Group Policy Objects (GPO) and Organizational Units (OU).

I have an HPE Proliant with Ubuntu Server installed and I run VMs with KVM/QEMU, using tools such as Virtual Machine Manager and virsh to manage the VMs.
The server has two Windows Server 2016 VMs installed, which I have been using to learn with. Eventually, I would like to experiment with more complex environments such as a multi-domain forest.

There's not much here at the moment as I've just created this repository. It was mainy a spur of the moment decision to make something like this. I hope to stick with it and continue adding material over time.
