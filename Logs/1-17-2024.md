I've been looking around for some good reading material about TCP/IP and Linux. Despite having learned a lot about general networking after preparing for the CompTIA A+ and Network+ certifications, I found that the content only scratches the surface of the various technologies and protocols that exist. Sure, I know what a router, switch and firewall is, but the exam guides don't dig that deep into the inner-workings (or as detailed as I'd like it to be). I feel like I'm left too many unanswered questions and sometimes I'll tend to hyperfocus on a particular subject, but I have to remember to leave plenty of time for other areas as well.

I've been using Linux for many years, but have also been curious about what Unix and Linux really is and how the kernel works. I've found several sources of information, in the form of PDF books, most of which target a specific area. I wanted to find something that would really teach me what Linux is and how it is related to Unix. I wanted to learn how the kernel actually works and what exactly happens from the moment the computer's power button is pressed.

I came across a book called "How Linux Works, 3rd Edition" by Brian Ward. I've only been reading it for a few days now before bed, but I'm really enjoying it so far. Since I've been a Linux user for over 10 years, I am already familiar with all of the common commands (i.e., cd, ls, man, grep) and working with pipes. Having hundreds of different little programs at my fingertips is one thing, but knowing how you can put them together to accomplish more complicated tasks is another. The most basic method of putting these individual commands and programs together is by using **pipes**. Pipes enable you to redirect the output of one command to another.
I am hoping to learn a lot more about Linux as I continue reading this book.

As for networking, I found another book called "_The Illustrated Network: How TCP/IP Works in a Modern Network_" by Walter Goralksi. I know much of the basics of networking, what the OSI model is, and what the purpose of switches and routers are. However, I'm curious about how the protocols actually work. For instance, I want to learn more about how the encapsulation of various protocols happens and how the individual layers of protocol stacks fit together. Having this knowledge, I believe, would give me a better understanding of protocols and would allow me to greatly improve my troublshooting skills. Taking a quick glance at the table of contents, I feel overwhelmed by the large number of different technologies. Most of the technologies and protocols I've read or heard about, but there's still many I don't know much about in detail. I'm hoping to learning as much as I can, when it comes to networking. After all, without networking, the world would be very different from what it has become now.

I know that having a good understanding of how protocols work is important for software developers that write networked applications, but I don't have any plans to become a software developer. I do enjoy learning how to program in my free time but, as far as programming goes, I'm more interested in shell scripting in Linux and PowerShell for Windows environments. I dabble with C sometimes as I had learned about its relationship with Unix and Linux, including the various functions that enable applications to perform privileged operations such as working with files or network sockets. I've also used Python for a brief amount of time and wrote the Game of Life using the pygame library, which was a lot of fun. I'm fascinated with what all the Game of Life can do with only a few simple rules. Some GoL nerds have made some very intricate systems in it, such as a functioning computer processor.

But that's about it. Today I'll probably continue reading the TCP/IP book I mentioned above and maybe a little bit of Linux on the side. I'm currently juggling between job searching and studying.
