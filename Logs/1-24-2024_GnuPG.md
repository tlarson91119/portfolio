## A little GnuPG
I've been using GnuPG a little more after learning a bit about key management (creating sub-keys and protecting the private master key by storing it offline). Asymmetric cryptography is a really interesting subject. Historically, key exchange used to be a difficult task with symmetric cryptography that used the same key for both encrypting and decrypting information.
You could share a key over the internet to a recipient, but there is a risk of that key being intercepted in transit. Key exchange in asymmetric cryptography involves two parties establishing a shared secret without ever sending it over the Internet and this is possible by using complicated math that's easy to compute but exponentially more difficult to reverse.

GnuPG is commonly used to communicate securely with other people. Each participant will generate their own public/private keypair. They kee their private key safe and only share their public key with whom they want to establish secure communications with. The recipient must also share their public key with you. Using the recipient's public key, you can encrypt a message with it and send it to the recipient. Only the recipient can decrypt the message because he/she has the corresponding private key.
A user's private key may also be used to "sign" a message. To sign a message, the user may generate a hash of the message (for integrity) and then encrypt that hash with his private key, effectively creating a signature. The recipient can verify the integrity and authenticity of a message by decrypting the signature with the sender's public key and comparing the hash of the decrypted message with the decrypted hash value.

That's about all I have for public/key cryptography. I'm still learning more about it.
