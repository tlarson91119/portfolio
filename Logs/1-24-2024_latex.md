## Quick Experience with LaTeX

I was reading an article somewhere in the depths of the Internet and came across a markup language called LaTeX. From what I've gathered by the article's brief introduction is that it is a markup which is written in plain text files which have the **.tex** extension. Using LaTeX, you can control and change the appearance of the content. It's commonly used to describe the appearance of complex mathematical formulas that are not easy (or impossible) to do in normal word processors (e.g., Microsoft Word). There might be plugins or extensions to the popular word processors that can display complicated formulas, but LaTeX was intended for such things (and more).

I've only spent about 2 to 3 hours running through a LaTeX guide, learning the basic structure of a plain LaTeX document. You can create tables, numbered lists, two-column pages and control how certain pieces of content are displayed. It kind of reminds me of CSS styling with HTML, but it's not quite the same.

One of the use-cases I thought of was being able to write programs that generate LaTeX documents which can be ran through what is called a _Tex engine_. An engine **compiles** your LaTeX into a final file format such as a PDF which allows easy viewing for anyone. When you write a LaTeX file, you can run <code>pdflatex _filename_</code> to compile a nice and portable PDF document that you can share with people.

Personally, I have not realized any cases where I would really need to write LaTeX, but I'm sure in the future I'll come up with something interesting as I continue learning more about programming.

## A little GnuPG
I've been using GnuPG a little more after learning a bit about key management (creating sub-keys and protecting the private master key by storing it offline). Asymmetric cryptography is a really interesting subject. Historically, key exchange used to be a difficult task with symmetric cryptography that used the same key for both encrypting and decrypting information.
You could share a key over the internet to a recipient, but there is a risk of that key being intercepted in transit. Key exchange in asymmetric cryptography involves two parties establishing a shared secret without ever sending it over the Internet and this is possible by using complicated math that's easy to compute but exponentially more difficult to reverse.

GnuPG is commonly used to communicate securely with other people. Each participant will generate their own public/private keypair. They kee their private key safe and only share their public key with whom they want to establish secure communications with. The recipient must also share their public key with you. Using the recipient's public key, you can encrypt a message with it and send it to the recipient. Only the recipient can decrypt the message because he/she has the corresponding private key.
A user's private key may also be used to "sign" a message. To sign a message, the user may generate a hash of the message (for integrity) and then encrypt that hash with his private key, effectively creating a signature. The recipient can verify the integrity and authenticity of a message by decrypting the signature with the sender's public key and comparing the hash of the decrypted message with the decrypted hash value.

That's about all I have for public/key cryptography. I'm still learning more about it.
