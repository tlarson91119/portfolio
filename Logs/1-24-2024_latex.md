## Quick Experience with LaTeX

I was reading an article somewhere in the depths of the Internet and came across a markup language called LaTeX. From what I've gathered by the article's brief introduction is that it is a markup which is written in plain text files which have the **.tex** extension. Using LaTeX, you can control and change the appearance of the content. It's commonly used to describe the appearance of complex mathematical formulas that are not easy (or impossible) to do in normal word processors (e.g., Microsoft Word). There might be plugins or extensions to the popular word processors that can display complicated formulas, but LaTeX was intended for such things (and more).

I've only spent about 2 to 3 hours running through a LaTeX guide, learning the basic structure of a plain LaTeX document. You can create tables, numbered lists, two-column pages and control how certain pieces of content are displayed. It kind of reminds me of CSS styling with HTML, but it's not quite the same.

One of the use-cases I thought of was being able to write programs that generate LaTeX documents which can be ran through what is called a _Tex engine_. An engine **compiles** your LaTeX into a final file format such as a PDF which allows easy viewing for anyone. When you write a LaTeX file, you can run <code>pdflatex _filename_</code> to compile a nice and portable PDF document that you can share with people.

Personally, I have not realized any cases where I would really need to write LaTeX, but I'm sure in the future I'll come up with something interesting as I continue learning more about programming.
