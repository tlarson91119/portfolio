I've been running my Proliant DL360 for a few months now and Ubuntu Server and its
  virtual machines are still healthy. I rebooted the server sometime and when
  reaching to press the power button, I couldn't help noticing the amount of
  dust that had built up on the front panel and around the edges of the disk
  drives.

I'll likely need to remove the drive caddies to make sure I clear everything. I'll
  need to do a little reading to see if there is anything important to consider
  before taking the disks out even though the server will be unplugged, because
  there's also a battery pack for the SmartStorage Array Controller. I don't want
  to make a mistake and lose my RAID configuration, so I will first save all of
  the configuration details to be safe.
  I'm thinking that I shouldn't have to disconnect the battery if it is only
  used for protecting data in the array controller's 2GB of memory and that
  the card's configuration is saved to non-volatile memory. I'll take a look
  at the manual.
