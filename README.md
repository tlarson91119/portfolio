### A collection of documentation/images I've accumulated throughout my studies.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
My name is Thomas and I've been studying various areas of information technology over the last few years and
have had some experience working as a computer technician at a small computer repair
store about 10 years ago. I've experimented with computers throughout my entire childhood.
Between the time I've stopped working at the computer store
and the time I rekindled my interest in IT in 2019, I worked in a couple jobs that were
un-related to IT. Despite my experience repairing desktops and laptops at a small store,
I realized that there was still a significant gap in my skill sets. I set my sights toward
attaining the CompTIA A+ and Network+ certifications, which has provided me with a better
understanding and visibility into the types of technologies being used in enterprise IT
environments. I concentrated on learning as much as I can about the IT world around me such
as the devices that interconnect the countless number of networks around the world. I've
been learning about the security mechanisms that protect these networks and the devices
within these networks. It's been a long journey so far, but there will always be more
to learn as the Internet continues to evolve as newer protocols are developed and deployed.<br><br>

At the root of this repository exists various directories, related to specific
subjects that I've been working with. Being a new repository, there is not much on here currently,
but I hope to continue adding content to it. I have a habit of taking lots of handwritten notes throughout
my studies. I'll discard many of these notes, but will keep the ones that I believe
will be useful in the field and I'll store those in a personal reference guide that I have been
compiling.

My decision to use a GitHub repository was a spur-of-the-moment decision. I'm certain there
are other platforms available to satisfy my requirements, but I'll continue using this
platform until I find something more suitable.<br><br>
