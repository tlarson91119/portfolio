The permissions of a file(s) can be listed with <code>ls -l</code>.
The <code>stat _filename_</code> command displays detailed information about a file's attributes, which include the file owner/group, access and modify dates, size and permissions.
Each file has a set of permissions for **owner**, **group**, and **other** which may each have their own set of permissions, depending on the requirements.
There are three main permissions: **read**(r), **write**(w), and **execute**(x).
