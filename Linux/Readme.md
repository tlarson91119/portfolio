This directory will contain notes and descriptions of my experiences
utilizing different *nix operating systems.

I run Ubuntu Server (jammy) on a Proliant DL360 to run virtual machines
and I have a dual-boot configuration on my master workstation with
Debian 12 and Windows. I mainly used Windows as my OS of
choice, but have dabbled with Linux on VMs and
used Ubuntu on my laptop for about 15 years now. When I was probably
5 years old, my Father showed me Suse 5.0 and Mandrake 6 or 7. Of course,
I had no idea what they were until I got older.

I wanted to learn more about how Linux worked so my idea was to see
what it would be like to use it daily. I initially used Debian on VirtualBox
for a few months and I was pretty happy with it. That's what led me to
install Debian 11 on a separate drive and configure GRUB2 to let
me switch between Windows and Debian. I've been running this setup
for about 6 months and have got pretty comfortable with it. Since then
I've already upgraded to Debian 12 and have been using it on the daily
for everything, except games. I can play some games without needing
to use an emulator, but I'll usually boot into Windows to game.

But anyway, Debian has been a lot of fun for me and I've been writing
some shell scripts and C code here and there. Sometimes I'll just use it to
watch YouTube all day or "surf" on CS:S on the weekend when I need a break.
